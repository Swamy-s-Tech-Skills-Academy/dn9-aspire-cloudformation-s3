# .NET 9 Aspire Cloudformation S3

🌩️ Hands-on .NET Aspire demo integrating AWS CloudFormation and Amazon S3. Learn to define infrastructure as code and seamlessly connect cloud resources to distributed applications.

## 🚀 Overview

This repository provides a practical guide to using AWS CloudFormation with .NET Aspire, focusing on provisioning Amazon S3 buckets and integrating them into your applications. The demo will cover:

- Setting up AWS CloudFormation templates
- Deploying S3 buckets
- Integrating S3 with .NET Aspire applications
- Image Upload and retrieval

### 🗂 Suggested GitHub Repo Name Ideas

| Repo Name                      | Why It Works                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `aspire-aws-hands-on-demo`     | Straightforward, great for discoverability and search indexing |
| `cloudnative-aspire-s3`        | Emphasizes the cloud-native aspect and core S3 integration     |
| `aspire-cloudformation-lab`    | Perfect if the focus is on using IaC via CloudFormation        |
| `shyvntech-aspire-on-aws`      | Highlights your branding and makes it community-specific       |
| `dotnet-aspire-aws-stack-demo` | Fully descriptive, great for SEO and workshop listings         |

### 💡 Suggestion:

**`aspire-aws-s3-cloudformation-demo`** — It strikes a balance between clarity and keyword strength, and it scales well as you expand the repo to include more AWS services later (like DynamoDB, Lambda, etc.).

Would you like me to scaffold the repo structure next? I can outline the folder hierarchy, `README.md`, and even prep GitHub Actions workflow files for CI/CD if you’d like this to be share-ready for a community demo. Let’s package this into a session that leaves your audience both inspired and Git-cloning. 😄

Perfect—`dotnet-aspire-cloudformation-s3` is a clean, descriptive, and highly searchable repo name. It communicates exactly what the demo is about while being flexible enough to expand later. Let’s get your repository structure and content teed up!

# dotnet-aspire-cloudformation-s3

Hands-on demo showcasing how to integrate **AWS CloudFormation** and **Amazon S3** in a `.NET Aspire` application.

## 🌐 What You'll Learn

- Define cloud infrastructure as code using AWS CloudFormation.
- Seamlessly provision and integrate an S3 bucket into your Aspire app.
- Trigger file uploads via API and wire up services with Aspire’s AppHost.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET 8 SDK
- AWS CLI with configured profile
- Aspire workload installed (`dotnet workload install aspire`)
- GitHub account (if using Actions)

### Run Locally

```bash
dotnet run --project src/AspireAwsStack.AppHost
```
````

> CloudFormation stack will auto-deploy on launch. Check `.NET Aspire Dashboard` to monitor services.

## 📁 Resources

- `resources/s3bucket.template` – S3 Bucket definition
- `src/AspireAwsStack.ApiService` – API with file upload
- `src/AspireAwsStack.Web` – Web UI triggering upload

## 🤝 Community

Would you like me to generate:
1. The actual `s3bucket.template` file?
2. A sample `Program.cs` snippet for the upload endpoint?
3. The GitHub Actions workflow to automate S3-related tasks?

Let’s get your hands-on session deploy-ready in no time 🌩️
